; void reverse()
; Recursively read in words, until none are found anymore.
; After the recursive calls are done, write out the word again.
reverseInputLines:

  call1_1 edx, readLine, input_buffer

  cmp edx, 0          ; If nothing was read, it means the
  jg there_is_input   ; input is already fully processed, i.e.
  ret                 ; that this call is finished.

there_is_input:
  
  mov eax, esp   ; Original stack pointer
  sub eax, edx   ; Enough space to store the read string

  mov ebx, 3     ; Complement of round-to-multiples-of-4 bitmask
  not ebx   
  and eax, ebx   ; Align stack location to 32-bit
  mov esp, eax   ; Allocate the space on the stack

  mov eax, 0     ; Index into the buffer when copying

  ; TO BE COMPLETED
